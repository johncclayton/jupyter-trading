CategoryCross-Sectional FunctionsDescriptionA secondary cross-sectional function, which requests that the primary function be calculated separately for each group of stocks that share the same corresponding industry indexExample
Ranks $SPX constituents separately by Norgate corresponding industry index. NotesSee also ?CII, CIIFamily, and CIILevel.See the cii_rotate.rts sample script for a complete example.
Section 17.18.3 #ByEcon
17.18.3. #ByEcon
CategoryCross-Sectional FunctionsDescriptionA secondary cross-sectional function, which requests that the primary function be calculated separately for each group of stocks that share the same economic sector nameExample
Calculates the average 100-bar ROC of all stocks in this economic sector and stores it as "EconROC" for each stock. NotesRequires data with ?EconSect names in each stock record.Norgate provides these automatically -- use Classification to specify which scheme to request at Import time.For other data sources you would need to provide them via a SymInfo file.
