Create a BNF lark grammar for the real test language.

Validation:
- use the validate_rts.py script to test an .rts file against the lark grammar
- this can be run without args to test ALL files in the /samples/ directory or use --file to pick a specific .rts file

Rules:
1. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE /samples/ directory - ever
2. When testing / validating - a common error is that a rule consumes EVERYTHING after it - make sure this is never the case.

Prerequisites:
1. Use the venv called 'realtestextract' for all python scripts - if it does not exist it can be set up via tools/setup_realtest_env.sh or via tools/setup_realtest_env.ps1

Behaviour:
1. Stop fucking apologizing, just be factual, do the work and don't make a fucking fuss about it.  Apologize one more time and I'm gonna fucking fire your ass.
