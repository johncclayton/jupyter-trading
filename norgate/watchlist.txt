US Delisted
Delisted Stocks are included with a US Stock Market subscription at the Platinum or Diamond level.

A security is only included in Delisted if it traded on a major exchange at some point in its history and is no longer tradeable. A security that has been relegated from a major exchange, but can still be traded on OTC, is not considered to be delisted. Such securities are included in a Platinum or Diamond subscription as currently-listed.

The symbol for a delisted security has a year & month suffix indicating when the security last traded - e.g. ALOG-201806.

Notes:
The US historical index constituents are essentially complete. There are instances where there are not exactly "1000" constituents for the Russell 1000 or "2000" for the Russell 2000 etc. There are a number of possible reasons for this:

FTSE Russell pre-announces the reconstitution of its Russell indexes at the end of May. If it a stock delists before the actual reconstitution date (late June) then it will not be included in the relevant index.
In the early 1990s, Russell indexes included a small number of stocks that had primary listings on what are now known as "regional exchanges", which means an exchange other than Nasdaq, NYSE or NYSE American (formerly NYSE American). We only include the 3 "major" exchanges in our coverage.
In the case of a spin-off, the spun-off stock appears in the index until the next reconstitution. This can cause the number of constituents to exceed the titled number.
Staggered reconstitutions can cause variations to the titled number. For instance, the Russell 2000 was reconstituted with 2019 stocks at the start at 1 Jul 2009.
Stocks that move to OTC are immediately removed from Russell, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Indices. However, S&P indices sometimes incorporate limited periods of OTC trading prior to index removal.
FTSE Russell adds new eligible IPOs on a quarterly basis. FTSE Russell occasionally adds new IPOs that currently trade on OTC prior to their major exchange listing if a major exchange IPO is due within the next quarter.

Notes:
The ASX historical index constituents are essentially complete. There are instances where there are not exactly "500" constituents for the All Ordinaries or "300" for the S&P/ASX 300 etc. This is generally due to delistings having occurred in between index re-balancing dates.

In March 2000, Standard & Poor's took over management of the ASX indices, introducing indices such as the S&P/ASX 200 and re-vamping the methodology for the All Ordinaries Index. Synthetic (theoretic) histories were provided for these indices.
The history of index constituent changes before March 2000 is also synthetic, with index re-balancing being performed notionally at the end of each month.
Therefore the record contains more constituent changes than would actually have occurred with re-balancing being performed annually or semi-annually as after March 2000. As a result, some stocks (those on the verge of index inclusion/exclusion) pop in and out of membership frequently.

Notes:
CA historical index constituents are essentially complete.

The S&P/TSX Completion methodology has changed significantly over time. It was formerly known as S&P/TSX MidCap (prior to Dec 2005) and S&P/TSE MidCap (prior to May 2002). When it was the MidCap index it only had 52-60 stocks ( May 2002-Nov 2005) and a fixed 60 (May 1999-Apr 2002). For the historical index constituents we use the current methodology (stocks in the S&P/TSX Composite that are not in the S&P/TSX 60).

The S&P/TSE SmallCap Index changed methodology significantly in Dec 2005 to become fully independent of the S&P/TSX Composite. The number of stocks within this index is variable and contained between 152 and 270 stocks since Dec 2005. Prior to Dec 2005 this it only included stocks within the S&P/TSX Composite and contained 92-180 stocks during that period.

The S&P/TSX MidCap (Inferred) index constituents are determined from stocks in the S&P/TSX Composite that are not in the S&P/TSX 60 or in the S&P/TSX SmallCap index.


Dividend
This indicator provides information about cash distributions that one would be entitled to if the security was held at the close on the day prior to the ex-dividend date.
The dividends shown are only those that have not already been incorporated in the stock price via the chosen adjustment method (eg: if you are already adjusting the price to account for capital reconstructions, special distributions and ordinary cash dividends, then no distributions will be shown when using this indicator).

Dividend Yield
This indicator provides a trailing 12 month sum of all split-adjusted ordinary dividends. It is calculated daily against the close price.
New dividends are incorporated on the entitlement date (the trading day prior to the ex-dividend date) after which the trailing 12 month sum of dividends is recalculated.
Special dividends, distributions and spin-offs are not included.
The lookback period is adaptive to take into account slight variations in ex-dividend dates from year-to-year.

Note:
Anomalies can occur for up to 12 months after a company first starts paying dividends (or re-starts after a hiatus), or when changes are made to the dividend payment frequency/timetable.

Padding Status
This indicator will show when a price record has been padded in accordance with the Date Padding setting. If the Date Padding is set to "No padding" then this indicator will not return any values.

US Major Exchange Listing identification
This indicator provides information about whether a stock was listed on a major exchange (e.g. NYSE, Nasdaq, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, IEX) or as an OTC/Pink Sheet stock for each trading date. Data for all Equities and ETPs is provided back to Jan 1995. Prior to this date, no information is provided.

Access to this indicator is only available with a US Stock Market subscription at the Platinum or Diamond levels.

US Blank Check Company identification
This indicator provides information about whether a stock was a Blank Check Company during its trading history. Blank Check Companies also include SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) and Capital Pool Companies. Blank Check Company data is provided for all Equities back to 1993, coinciding with the SECs regulations that took effect that year.

Access to this indicator is only available with a US Stock Market subscription at the Platinum or Diamond levels.

Capital Event
This indicator will show when a capital event occurred. Effective on holding the security at the close on the day prior to the ex-date. Events include splits, reverse splits, bonus issues, stock dividends (dividends paid as stock) and complex reorganizations of capital.

Current Fundamentals
Current fundamental and broker forecast information is provided by Refinitiv. The fields listed in the tables below contain current fundamentals only (historical data is not available).

Items that reference the latest price (such as Beta and Market Cap) are calculated daily, however the data doesn't arrive from Refinitiv until well after the market has closed. "Current dividend yield, trailing 12 months" and "Trailing 12 month Ordinary Dividends per Share" are calculated by Norgate Data shortly after the market close data has arrived.

Other fundamentals are reported at different times and for different periods. Items such as Earnings per Share are typically included with each quarterly or half-yearly company report whilst others may only be reported on a half-yearly or annual basis.

Units: Per Share and per Employee figures are shown in dollars. Growth/Change/Return figures are shown in %. Other dollar-based items (such as market cap, revenue etc.) are show in milions.

Date: A date is provided for each fundamental field representing the last date of the reporting period from the most recent report of that field. For example, a trailing twelve month fundamental item will show the date of the most recently-reported quarter (or half, for half-yearly reporting companies). The date in the "Most recent fiscal year" fundamentals will provide the last date of that fiscal year. Some companies report quarterly/interim figures in a staggered fashion over several weeks, so some items will have an earlier period until they are reported.

"Fundamentals" are included with stock market subscriptions at the Gold, Platinum or Diamond levels.
